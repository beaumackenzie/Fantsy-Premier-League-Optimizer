# Fantsy-Premier-League-Optimizer


Uses current and previous year's playing time, xG, and xA data to generate an optimal FPL lineup at current costs against a neutral opponent on a neutral field.
Costs are scraped with a different script from FPL's API.

TODO:

Generate up-to-date player xGs from sportsbook odds and up-to-date team xGAs from sportsbook odds.
A four-week transfer planner with one injury substitution is also in the works.
